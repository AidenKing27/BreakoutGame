## ITEC 145 - Final Project Options

You have the choice of **three** options:

### 1) Non-Game Program
Create your own project, completely of your own idea, consisting of at least **two classes** and demonstrating a level of sophistication beyond what we are doing in class. 

If you have any questions, please ask me if your project is sophisticated enough. Examples of projects:
- Inventory system
- Banking app
- Student records system

---

### 2) Game Project
Under this category, there are **two** options:

#### A) **Enhanced Game**
Using the **CopterGameDemo code or soemthing Steve showed you last week** as a **starting point**, continue to develop a unique and complete **game** with added features beyond what is covered in class. 

> **Important:** Submitting the project as it was done in class **will not receive a passing grade**.

##### Ideas for additional features:
- Keep score and end the game at **10 points**
- Drop some items from the copter
- Make items bounce around during the game and get **faster** as the game progresses
- Allow users to **enter names** and store them in a class/struct/list
- Keep track of **users and their scores**
- Add **floating background graphics**
- Add **more detail to ball, paddles, copter, etc and/or add animations**
- Implement a **splash screen**

#### B) **Unique Game of Your Own Creation**
You may create a completely **original game**. 

> **Copying an existing game from the Internet is NOT acceptable.**

Your game must include concepts **beyond what we have done in class**, including:
- **Classes**
- **Lists**

##### Examples:
- A **top-down 2D adventure game** where players move around the screen, collect objects, and avoid roving monsters.
- A **card game** such as poker.
- A **adevnture game** maybe one that utilizes Generative AI?
- etc, talk to me if you need to brainstorm ideas

## Code Integrity and Academic Policy
Your code **must be of your own creation**. You may research individual commands and methods to solve problems, but the **majority of the code must be your own**. 

> **Any copying of partial or complete projects will result in failure of the final and the class.**

Additionally, **if you are not present and working on your project during the last 4 weeks of class, it will result in an automatic fail.**
